     Timer countdown system V2
     System installation:
     1) Add this script to a button's child gameObject, which is the text object. 
        Note: the button, which has the text gameObject is the one that will used for spawning certain objects in the game.
     2) Them add the required system configuration GameObjects(which are indicated by the [SerializeField] property), which will be used for outputting certain data on the game screen.
     3) Then start the current game prortotype and check if this timer is working

     The way it works:
     1) When the user clicks on the button, the boolean value startcountdown is setted to true and the current timer's button 
        interactable state is setted to false. As well, once clicked on the button, a message apears on the UI Text component, which indicates that
        a timer has started working.

     2) The boolean value is signal for starting the timer coundown. Once this value is true, the system takes the timeStart variable
        and subtracts it by using the Unity system's frame time class Time variable's deltaTime value, which the current game time in
        Unity. When it subtracts it, then the system uses the Mathf.Round() function for rounding the variable, so the time data could
        be more easily understand and looking more appealing to the user when comes by printing information in the game window.

     3) When the system tryes calculating the certain time, it tryes calculating from the starting time value in seconds from the timeStart variable's
        value to 0. Whyle it is calculating it prints the current timeStart value on the button text. Once the timer has done counting then
        it uses the string variable startBtn to rest the current timer's button text variable's value by setting the button's text value to be the starting
        button's text.
